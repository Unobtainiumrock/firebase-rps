# Firebase Rock Paper Scissors

Used Firebase to make a rock paper scissors game. The data that persists in firebase includes the number of instances of the app running (as connections), each player's name/scores/choice, and messages.

## Getting Started
For graders testing functionality:
* 1) Use the delete Fire Base button to clear out the Fire Base
* 2) Refresh each tab for the game after clearing the DB out, in order to have a fresh start
* note: it will cycle through rounds just fine after you go through your first round.
